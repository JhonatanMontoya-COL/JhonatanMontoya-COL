- 👋 Hi, I’m Jhonatan Montoya and I am currently studying software development,
  I love programming and all the thighs related to system and engineering, I've got a B2 English level and I practice it every single day just
  because I really want to become more fluent and understand spoken English better; Due to I thought I was lacked of math skills, I am also studying
  math and physics by my own, however, and due to it has been a lot of time since I started doing that, I'd say I have become actually more able to understand and
  give solutions for the problems that there could be.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in Aerospace engineering on the way proggraming rockets and satellites, but i already now that, before starting studying that, I have to learn the basics
- of how to program simple things and how to develop software.
- I love VideoGames, mostly when they are story-telling or ci-fi.
- I enjoy playing football with my friend.
- I like to spend time with my family, reading books and editing videos.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathematics, physics and how to create web pages using elements of front and back-end using frameworks such as Laravel and Vue.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Development Projects and I'd really appreciate if I could work on their backend.
